On Tuesday we spoke at the weekly Rotary Hamilton meeting at the Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Association and announced that we have added two datasets:

* [The audited financial statements of the Bermuda Hospitals Board (BHB)](http://bermuda.io/dataset/bermuda-hospitals-board-bhb-audited-financials)
* [The audited financial statements of the Bermuda Land Development Corporation (BLDC)](http://bermuda.io/dataset/bermuda-land-development-corporation-bldc-audited-financials)

As we went to the heart of the operations of Government in our initial launch we plan on making the financials of all Government controlled organizations accessible.

To begin we have selected the BHB as it is the largest government controlled organization and the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital (KEMH) is nearing completion of a [large building project](http://www.bermudahospitals.bm/bhb/initiativesInProgress/redevelopment-project/index.asp). Please note we are currently missing the audited financial statements for the following years: 1993 to 1994 and 1998 to 1999. If you have access to these please [contact us](mailto:info@bermuda.io).

And the BLDC because its a complete dataset from their inception and it takes into account the old base lands (including Morgan's point).

In case you missed it or would like to listen to it again here is a recording of the speech Andrew Simons gave at Rotary which which was later broadcasted on ZBM on Tuesday evening:
