[![Latest Estimates of Revenue and Expenditures](/images/2014-03/estimated-budget-cover.png)](http://bermuda.io/dataset/budget-book-estimates-of-revenue-and-expenditure-for-the-year/resource/e0d52ac9-1678-452b-bf2d-31c342455f2d)

Members of the Legislature are in the midst of the annual budget debate. Most discussions in the House of Assembly and the Senate will refer to the "Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for the year 2014/15", otherwise known as the "Budget Book." This 406 page document presents, by department, historical, current, and estimated data on: spending, staffing numbers, and performance.

We have scanned the Budget Book and published a searchable, downloadable PDF at: [http://bermuda.io/dataset/budget-book-estimates-of-revenue-and-expenditure-for-the-year/resource/e0d52ac9-1678-452b-bf2d-31c342455f2d](http://bermuda.io/dataset/budget-book-estimates-of-revenue-and-expenditure-for-the-year/resource/e0d52ac9-1678-452b-bf2d-31c342455f2d).

Budget Books for the previous 20 years are available on our online repository: [http://bermuda.io/dataset/budget-book-estimates-of-revenue-and-expenditure-for-the-year](http://bermuda.io/dataset/budget-book-estimates-of-revenue-and-expenditure-for-the-year). Indeed, the site contains collections of the financial statements of many other government funds and organisations.

We hope this detailed, department by department, dataset will enrich public discussion about the budget. In our view, it makes more sense for this information to be widely available during the budget debate, not after the fact.
